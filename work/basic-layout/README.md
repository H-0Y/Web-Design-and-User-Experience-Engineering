# Assignment - Basic Layout

**Due: Thu Sep 22, 11:59pm PT** 

# Goal

You will fill in the matching stylesheet for the provided HTML so that the rendered page matches the provided mockup image (differences due to browser window size are expected - your page should work for a wide range of desktop window sizes, but is not expected to work at mobile sizes yet).

# Submission Instructions

* start from the up-to-date main branch (`git checkout main; git pull origin main`)
* Create a feature branch named 'basic-layout' (`git checkout -b basic-layout`)
* add the necessary file in this directory (or a subdirectory) to have the required features
* add, commit, and push the branch to github
* Create a PR to merge to main
* Be sure to include the TA(s) and myself reviewer(s)

# Requirements

- Do not modify the html file
- The white border seen in the sample image is the default margin of the body - you can leave that or remove it, your choice.
- A trick is that you can put a border on just one side: `border-bottom: 1px solid black;` or `border-right: 1px solid black;`
- The colors used are all named colors: black, plum, rebeccapurple, and pink. 
- You can view the file using either `File->Open File` in Chrome or by serving the page by using `npx serve` in this directory and visiting `http://localhost:3000/homepage.html` in the browser.
- The links are not going to work if you follow them - that's fine, they are not part of the assignment.
