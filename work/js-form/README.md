# Assignment - JS Form

**Due: Thu Nov 3, 11:59pm PT** 

# Goal

Building an index.html page in public/ that contains a form that is validated by JS
- The form will use a variety of validation methods, as described below
- The form will show a layout in 1 column format for a "mobile" size
- The form will show a layout in 2 column format for a "desktop" size
- Write any necessary CSS and JS files
- DO NOT MODIFY server.js

The code is usable by:
- Running `npm install` **in this directory** 
  - only needs to run **in this directory** once per computer
- Running `npm start` **in this directory**
  - Visiting http://localhost:3000/

## Form Details

- The page will have a visually distinct header and footer
- The page will contain a registration form that will submit to "/register" using POST
- The form will collect these fields
  - Name
  - Email
  - Confirm Email
  - A checkbox with name "wants-spam"
    - Label of your choice
  - A select menu with name "tier"
    - Label and options and values of your choice
- Each form field will have label text that meaningfully identifies the field being collected
- The fields will have the following validations
  - Name is required
  - Email is required
    - There is no validating the content of the email for this assignment!
  - Confirm Email must match the Email
- The validations will NOT be done with HTML validations
  - This is to confirm your understanding of JS validation, not because HTML validation is good or bad
  - No "required" attributes
  - No "pattern" attributes
  - No 'type="email"' - use 'type="text"` (the default for input) instead
- All "required" fields will be indicated to the user as required before they fill the form out
- Any field validation failures will be shown by extra text
  - In addition to any initial text saying a field is required (when that applies)
  - Color alone is not sufficient to indicate an error, but color should be used
- All failed validations will be indicated to the user when the validations fail as described below
  - The Name field will inform the user they need to fill out the field if they have not
    - This error text will be always present in the HTML but the styling will make it shown/not shown
    - This validation will occur when the change event occurs on the field OR the user attempts to submit the form
    - This error message will not be shown if this error is fixed (the field is provided)
  - The Email field will inform the user they need to fill out the field if they have not
    - This error text will NOT be present in the HTML, it is added/removed using `.innerText` when the validation fails
    - This validation will occur when the user goes to submit the form
    - This error message will be removed if this error is fixed (the field is provided) and the user attempts to submit
  - The Confirm Email field will inform the user the field needs to match Email if it does not
    - This error text will NOT be present in the HTML, it is added/removed using `.innerText` when the validation fails
    - This validation will occur when the user goes to submit the form
    - This error message will be removed if this error is fixed (the field matches) and the user attempts to submit
  - All fields are validated when the form is submitted
    - If a validation is failed the form will not submit

## Accessibility Requirements
- The form can be navigated and used with keyboard (using tab, typing, and space) or mouse
- Required fields are labeled as such in a way that do not require color-sightedness
- Errors are indicated with additional text that do not require color-sightedness to read
- The page will have an adaptive breakpoint at 40rem
  - Above this breakpoint the form will use a 2 column layout
  - Below this breakpoint the form will use a 1 column layout
  - The column requirements do not apply to checkboxes - use whatever formatting looks good
- The page should have a reasonable layout for a range of widths, from 360px to 1000px (with normal text-size)

## Additional Requirements
- All CSS class names should be semantic kebab-case or BEM style (or a mix of the two)
- Do not use var
- Use let and const as described in class
- Load your JS as described in class
- Use meaningful and helpful variable names as described in class
- Use consistent indentation and helpful whitespace to make your JS, HTML, and CSS easy to read
- Use semicolons appropriately 
- Add event listener(s) as described in class
- Do not use float
- Do not use tables or table-layouts
- Follow the best practices shared to date in this course
