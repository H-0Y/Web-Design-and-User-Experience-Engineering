# Assignment - Testing node and git

**Due: Thu Sep 15, 11:59pm PT** 

# Instructions

NOTE: This assumes you have followed all of the instructions from the "setup-for-this-class" document.  Do that first.

**From this directory**, at the command line:

1. Run `npm install`
  * Did you run this **in the correct directory?** See "readings/the-command-line.md" in this repo for more information.
  * In response to running this command you should see some text while it downloads a library or two
  * If you see a permission error (EACCES) you probably installed something as root/administrator, and now your normal user account can't override it. That's a bit messy to clean up, but it's doable and you want to clean that up NOW rather than later in the semester.
  * Lots of ways of addressing this exist, with varying levels of success and computer security.  Speak up on Slack if this is an issue for you.
  * You only need to run this successfully once.  Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the program (see below) as much as needed without reinstalling.  Reinstalling is only necessary if the dependencies are changed.
1. Run `node parse.js`  
  * You should see an error about "people.html" not existing
1. You are going to make changes, so you should first create a "feature branch" to create those changes in
  * run `git checkout -b setup-test`
  * This branch name, "setup-test", is specific to this assignment.  Each assignment will be done in its own branch with a unique name.
1. Create a file in this directory, "people.html".  
  * Edit this file to be valid HTML (including doctype!) with a title element that says "About Me"
  * The unordered list should have the class of `person`
  * You should should have 4 li elements inside your unordered list element
  * Each li element should have text for a human label inside it: "Name", "NEUID", "Slackhandle", and "Github Username"
  * Inside each li, after the text for humans, you should have a single span element
    * The span element should have a class attribute with a value that corresponds to the data inside it ("name", "neuid", "slackhandle", and "github")
    * The span elements should contain the text for that value (example: Your name is inside the span with class "name")
    * Not the Slackhandle should start with "@".  These values, particularly the github username, are case sensitive!
  * Make sure your data is accurate for you!
  * Don't forget to open and close your tags appropriately
  * Don't forget to use double quotes around the values of your attributes
  * Don't forget to include necessary elements (example: html and body, and an unordered list requires list item (li) elements), as well as a doctype
  * To search/google for info, Use `MDN (element)` to search, for example `MDN unordered list` 
  * Example: my span element for "name" would look like `<span class="name">Brett Ritter</span>`
1. If open the people.html file in Chrome, it should resemble the output in sample.png
1. Run `node parse.js` again now that you've saved your changes
  * You should see your information output
  * Everything should run smoothly
  * Fix any errors that do turn up and repeat this step until everything runs smoothly
1. Add the file to the list of files to commit: `git add people.html`
1. Run `git status` and make sure nothing is listed as an 'Untracked file' and only `people.html` is listed to be added.
  * I have never heard *anyone* say "I run git status too much".  It is much easier to clean up a commit BEFORE you make it, so always run git status before doing a commit.  Always pay attention to the output of git status.  Multiple students forget this step each semester.
  * If you have git troubles, I recommend consulting the list of common solutions at https://ohshitgit.com
1. Commit the file: `git commit -m "Adds MYNAME"` (Example: `git commit -m"Adds Lex"`
  * This commit message reflects your changes.  If you make other changes and have to commit those, and when you commit other assignments, the commit messages should reflect THOSE changes, they should NOT say "Adds MYNAME".
  * Repeat: Future assignments should not have commit messages that say "Adds MYNAME", that is specific to this assignment
1. Send your changes to github: `git push origin setup-test` 
1. Go to the github page for this repository and create a Pull Request(PR), with 'main' on the left dropdown and your setup-test branch on the right dropdown.
  * Do not merge, you must create a Pull Request.  Your repositories should be set so that you cannot merge to main without a Pull Request, but they are created without that requirement so there is a period of time where you can merge, but you shouldn't do it.  Learn how to create the PR, because that's how all assignments for the class will be turned in, and if you do it wrong, your grade could suffer.
  * Add myself and the TA to review the PR.  If you don't do this, we may not know your work is ready and you won't get credit for it.
2. If the changes look correct, Create the Pull Request.
  * If you edited and added a `.gitignore` file, that change should be listed as well as your changes to people.html
  * There should NOT be changes to other files.
  * Be sure to **add me (and any TAs) as reviewer** on the PR.
1. Remember to return the main branch!  `git checkout main`.  In this branch, your changes do not exist (not until they are approved, merged in, and you pull the updated main branch)

Then you're done! At some point your code will be reviewed merged into main. This is where our work is different than a "real" job: For most employers you are usually responsible for merging your code after it is approved, but for this class the TA/instructor will merge it after approval.
